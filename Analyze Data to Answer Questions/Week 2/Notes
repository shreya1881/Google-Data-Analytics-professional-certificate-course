-> Incorrectly formatted data can lead to time-consuming mistakes in your analysis, and might end up affecting your stakeholders' decision-making.
   To aboid these, data formatting is needed.

-> Converting the wind speed in Column D from miles per hour (mph) to meters per second (m/s) using CONVERT.  In cell H2, enter:
=CONVERT(D2, "mph", "m/s")

-> To join two strings or dates or numbers or values we use CONCAT or CONCATENATE. CONCAT takes in two values, CONCATENATE can take more than 2.

-> what data validation does in spreadsheets? Basically, it allows you to control what can and can't be entered in your worksheet. Usually, data validation is used to 
   add drop-down lists to cells with predetermined options for users to choose from. If you have a spreadsheet with a lot of collaborators, this can make it easier 
   for them to interact with your table. 

-> Data Validation:
   1. Add dropdown lists with predetermined options.
   2. Create custom checkboxes.
   3. Protect structured data and formulas.

-> Data validation can help your team track progress, protect your tables from breaking when working in big teams, and help you customize tables to your needs.

-> Numeric (number) can be converted to:
      - Integer
      - Numeric (number)
      - Big number
      - Floating integer
      - String

-> String can be converted to:
      - Boolean
      - Integer
      - Numeric (number)
      - Big number
      - Floating integer
      - String
      - Bytes
      - Date
      - Date time
      - Time
      - Timestamp 
      
-> Date can be converted to:
      - String
      - Date
      - Date time
      - Timestamp

-> CAST syntax:
CAST(expression AS typename)

-> Converting number to string
SELECT CAST(MyCount AS STRING)from MYTABLE

      SELECT indicates that you will be selecting data from a table

      CAST indicates that you will be converting the data you select to a different data type

      AS comes before and identifies the data type which you are casting to

      STRING indicates that you are converting the data to a string

      FROM indicates which table you are selecting the data from

-> Converting string to number
SELECT CAST(Myvarcharcol as INT) from mytable

-> Using IF statement for formulas in spreadsheet is very helpful.
   IF(end>start, end-start, 1-start+end)

-> Best practices for searching online:
   1. Thinking skills
   2. Data analytics terms
   3. Basic knowledge of tools

-> R is another programming language, but it's not a database language like SQL. It's a programming language frequently used for statistical analysis, 
   visualization, and other data analysis. R is a little different from other tools we've been working with, but it's a great complement for the tools you're 
   already using. With R, you'll be able to analyze and visualize data in all kinds of new ways.
