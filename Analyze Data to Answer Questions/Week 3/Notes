-> Data aggregation is the process of gathering data from multiple sources in order to combine it into a single summarized collection. In data analytics, a 
   summarized collection, or summary, describes identifying the data you need and gathering it all together in one place.

-> Data aggregation helps data analyst identify trends, make comparisons and gain insights that wouldn't be possible if each of the data elements were analyzed on 
   its own. 

-> subquery, also called an inner or nested query, is a query within another query.

-> VLOOKUP stands for vertical lookup. Basically, it's a function that searches for a certain value in a column to return a corresponding piece of information.
   =VLOOKUP(search_key,range,index,[is_sorted])

-> VALUE is a function that converts a text string that represents a number to a numerical value.

-> An absolute reference is a reference that is locked so that rows and columns won't change when copied. 

-> MATCH, which is a function used to locate the position of a specific lookup value and can help you with version control. 

-> search_key
      The value to search for. 

      For example, 42, "Cats", or I24.

   range 
      The range to consider for the search. 

      The first column in the range is searched to locate data matching the value specified by search_key.

   index
      The column index of the value to be returned, where the first column in range is numbered 1. 

      If index is not between 1 and the number of columns in range, #VALUE! is returned.

   is_sorted 
      Indicates whether the column to be searched (the first column of the specified range) is sorted. TRUE by default.

-> Itâ€™s recommended to set is_sorted to FALSE. If set to FALSE, an exact match is returned. If there are multiple matching values, the content of the cell 
   corresponding to the first value found is returned, and #N/A is returned if no such value is found.

   If is_sorted is TRUE or omitted, the nearest match (less than or equal to the search key) is returned. If all values in the search column are greater than
  the search key, #N/A is returned.

-> JOIN is a SQL clause that's used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column. 

-> There are four common JOINs data analysts use, inner, left, right, and outer. 

-> Primary keys reference columns in which each value is unique to that table. But that table can have multiple foreign keys which are primary keys in other 
   tables. For example, in a table about employees, the employee ID is a primary key and the office ID is a foreign key. JOIN use these keys to identify
   relationships and corresponding values. 
   
   An inner JOIN is a function that returns records with matching values in both tables.

-> A LEFT JOIN is a function that will return all the records from the left table and only the matching records from the right table. Here's how you can figure 
   out which table is left or right. In English and SQL we read from left to right. The table mentioned first is left and the table mentioned second is right. 
   You can also think of left as a table name to the left of the JOIN statement and right as a table name to the right of the JOIN statement.
   
   RIGHT JOIN does the opposite. It will return all records from the right table and only the matching records from the left.
   
   OUTER join combines RIGHT and LEFT JOIN to return all matching records in both tables. This means it will return all records in both tables. If there are 
   records in one table without a match, it'll create a record with no values for the other table. 

-> Aliasing is the process of using aliases. Aliases are used in SQL queries to create temporary names for a column or table. Aliases make referencing tables and 
   columns in your SQL queries much simpler when you have table or column names that are too long or complex to make use of in queries. Imagine a table name 
   like special_projects_customer_negotiation_mileages. 

-> JOIN syntax: SELECT, FROM, JOIN, ON

-> COUNT can be used to count the total number of numerical values within a specific range in spreadsheets. COUNT in SQL does the same thing. COUNT is a query that
   returns the number of rows in a specified range, but COUNT DISTINCT is a little different. 
   COUNT DISTINCT is a query that only returns the distinct values in that range. Basically, this means COUNT DISTINCT doesn't count repeating values.

-> Aliasing is when you temporarily name a table or column in your query to make it easier to read and write. Because these names are temporary, they only last for
   the given query.

-> A subquery is a SQL query that is nested inside of a larger query.

-> Your larger query can have a subquery in it and then that subquery could have a subquery, and then that subquery can have another subquery. But when you stack 
   them all together, they make one query. With subqueries you can combine different pieces of logic together. Because the logic of your outer query relies on the 
   inner query, you can get more done with a single query. This means all of the logic is in one place, which makes it more efficient and easier to read. 
   
   The statement containing the subquery can also be called the outer query or the outer select. This makes the subquery the inner query or inner select.
   The inner query executes first so that the results can be passed on to the outer query to use. 
   
   Subqueries can get a little confusing because there's so many layers. But if you keep in mind that the innermost query executes first, it'll be easier to order
   your subqueries when you want them to execute. Subqueries can also be nested inside all sorts of other queries. Usually you'll find subqueries nested in FROM or
   WHERE clauses.
