-> Data aggregation is the process of gathering data from multiple sources in order to combine it into a single summarized collection. In data analytics, a 
   summarized collection, or summary, describes identifying the data you need and gathering it all together in one place.

-> Data aggregation helps data analyst identify trends, make comparisons and gain insights that wouldn't be possible if each of the data elements were analyzed on 
   its own. 

-> subquery, also called an inner or nested query, is a query within another query.

-> VLOOKUP stands for vertical lookup. Basically, it's a function that searches for a certain value in a column to return a corresponding piece of information.
   =VLOOKUP(search_key,range,index,[is_sorted])

-> VALUE is a function that converts a text string that represents a number to a numerical value.

-> An absolute reference is a reference that is locked so that rows and columns won't change when copied. 

-> MATCH, which is a function used to locate the position of a specific lookup value and can help you with version control. 

-> search_key
      The value to search for. 

      For example, 42, "Cats", or I24.

   range 
      The range to consider for the search. 

      The first column in the range is searched to locate data matching the value specified by search_key.

   index
      The column index of the value to be returned, where the first column in range is numbered 1. 

      If index is not between 1 and the number of columns in range, #VALUE! is returned.

   is_sorted 
      Indicates whether the column to be searched (the first column of the specified range) is sorted. TRUE by default.

-> Primary keys reference columns in which each value is unique to that table. But that table can have multiple foreign keys which are primary keys in other 
   tables. For example, in a table about employees, the employee ID is a primary key and the office ID is a foreign key. JOIN use these keys to identify
   relationships and corresponding values. An inner JOIN is a function that returns records with matching values in both tables.
      Itâ€™s recommended to set is_sorted to FALSE. If set to FALSE, an exact match is returned. If there are multiple matching values, the content of the cell 
      corresponding to the first value found is returned, and #N/A is returned if no such value is found.

      If is_sorted is TRUE or omitted, the nearest match (less than or equal to the search key) is returned. If all values in the search column are greater than
      the search key, #N/A is returned.

-> JOIN is a SQL clause that's used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column. 

-> There are four common JOINs data analysts use, inner, left, right, and outer.
