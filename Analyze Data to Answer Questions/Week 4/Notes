-> COUNTIF returns the number of cells that match a specified value.

-> summary table, which is a table used to summarize statistical information about data. 

-> SUMIF is a function that adds numeric data based on one condition. Building a formula with SUMIF is a bit different than one with COUNTIF. 
   They both start the same way with an equal sign and the function, but a SUMIF formula contains the range of cells to be evaluated by your criteria, and the
   criteria. In other words, SUMIF has a list of cells to check based on the criteria you set in the formula. Then the range where we want to add the numbers is 
   placed in the formula if that range is different from the range being evaluated. There's commas between each of these parts. Adding a space after each comma is 
   optional. 

-> SUMPRODUCT is a function that multiplies arrays and returns the sum of those products. Here's what the SUMPRODUCT formula looks like; equal sign, the SUMPRODUCT 
   followed by an open parenthesis and arrays being multiplied and then added together. Each array is separated by a comma. An array is kind of like a range in a 
   spreadsheet. But keep in mind, an array is a collection of values in cells, not the cells themselves. When added to a formula, the SUMPRODUCT function multiplies
   each of the values in two or more arrays together. 

-> The profit margin is a percentage that indicates how many cents of profit have been generated for each dollar of sale.

-> First, we need to find out how much revenue was generated each year. A pivot table is a good way to organize this. So we'll build a pivot table to show this. 
   In our pivot table, we can also find the average revenue per movie. We can then check our findings for some possible trends.

-> A calculated field is a new field within a pivot table that carries out certain calculations based on the values of other fields.

-> An operator is a symbol that names the type of operation or calculation to be performed in a formula. 
   The four basic arithmetic operators in spreadsheet formulas are the plus sign for addition, the minus or hyphen for subtraction, the asterisk for multiplication, 
   and the forward slash for division. These same operators calculate data in the same way when writing queries in SQL. The operators are embedded in the queries 
   when pulling data from a database. Just like spreadsheet formulas, there's a few different ways to perform calculations using queries. 

-> We start with SELECT and then the names of the columns we want to use in our calculations. Then we add in calculation details including an operator like a 
   forward slash for division. Next, we type AS followed by the new column name to label the column with the calculated values. Finally, we end our query with the
   FROM command and the name of the table that we're pulling data from. 

-> GROUP BY is a command that groups rows that have the same values from a table into summary rows. The GROUP BY command is used with SELECT statements. In a basic 
   SELECT FROM or SELECT-FROM-WHERE query, GROUP BY comes at the end of the query.

-> Data Validation: This process involves checking and rechecking the quality of your data so that it is complete, accurate, secure, and consistent. While the 
   data validation process is a form of data cleaning, you should use it throughout your analysis.

-> The data validation process is a form of data cleaning. During this process, data analysts check the quality of their data to make sure itâ€™s complete, accurate,
   secure, and consistent.
   
   6 types of Data Validation:
   1) Data Type
   2) Data Range
   3) Data constraints
   4) Data consistency
   5) Data structure
   6) Code validation

-> Checking and rechecking the quality of your data during data validation process helps ensure the data is complete, accurate, secure and consistent. Sorting and
   filtering are not goals of data validation.
