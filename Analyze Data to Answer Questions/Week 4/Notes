-> COUNTIF returns the number of cells that match a specified value.

-> summary table, which is a table used to summarize statistical information about data. 

-> SUMIF is a function that adds numeric data based on one condition. Building a formula with SUMIF is a bit different than one with COUNTIF. 
   They both start the same way with an equal sign and the function, but a SUMIF formula contains the range of cells to be evaluated by your criteria, and the
   criteria. In other words, SUMIF has a list of cells to check based on the criteria you set in the formula. Then the range where we want to add the numbers is 
   placed in the formula if that range is different from the range being evaluated. There's commas between each of these parts. Adding a space after each comma is 
   optional. 

-> SUMPRODUCT is a function that multiplies arrays and returns the sum of those products. Here's what the SUMPRODUCT formula looks like; equal sign, the SUMPRODUCT 
   followed by an open parenthesis and arrays being multiplied and then added together. Each array is separated by a comma. An array is kind of like a range in a 
   spreadsheet. But keep in mind, an array is a collection of values in cells, not the cells themselves. When added to a formula, the SUMPRODUCT function multiplies
   each of the values in two or more arrays together.
