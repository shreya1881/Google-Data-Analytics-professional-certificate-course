ASK PHASE OF DATA ANALYSIS

In the ask step, we define the problem we're solving and make sure that we fully understand stakeholder expectations. This will help keep you focused on the 
actual problem, which leads to more successful outcomes.

STRUCTURED THINKING

Structured thinking is the process of recognizing the current problem or situation, organizing available information, revealing gaps and opportunities, and 
identifying the options. In this process, you address a vague, complex problem by breaking it down into smaller steps, and then those steps lead you to a logical 
solution.

Step 1: Ask
It’s impossible to solve a problem if you don’t know what it is. These are some things to consider:

   Define the problem you’re trying to solve 

   Make sure you fully understand the stakeholder’s expectations

   Focus on the actual problem and avoid any distractions

   Collaborate with stakeholders and keep an open line of communication

   Take a step back and see the whole situation in context

Questions to ask yourself in this step: 
   What are my stakeholders saying their problems are?

   Now that I’ve identified the issues, how can I help the stakeholders resolve their questions?
   
Step 2: Prepare 
You will decide what data you need to collect in order to answer your questions and how to organize it so that it is useful. You might use your business task 
to decide: 

   What metrics to measure

   Locate data in your database

   Create security measures to protect that data

Questions to ask yourself in this step: 
   What do I need to figure out how to solve this problem?

   What research do I need to do?
   
Step 3: Process
Clean data is the best data and you will need to clean up your data to get rid of any possible errors, inaccuracies, or inconsistencies. This might mean:

   Using spreadsheet functions to find incorrectly entered data 

   Using SQL functions to check for extra spaces

   Removing repeated entries

   Checking as much as possible for bias in the data

Questions to ask yourself in this step: 
   What data errors or inaccuracies might get in my way of getting the best possible answer to the problem I am trying to solve?

   How can I clean my data so the information I have is more consistent?
