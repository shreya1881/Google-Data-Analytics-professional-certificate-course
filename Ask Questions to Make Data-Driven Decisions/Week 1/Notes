ASK PHASE OF DATA ANALYSIS

In the ask step, we define the problem we're solving and make sure that we fully understand stakeholder expectations. This will help keep you focused on the 
actual problem, which leads to more successful outcomes.

STRUCTURED THINKING

Structured thinking is the process of recognizing the current problem or situation, organizing available information, revealing gaps and opportunities, and 
identifying the options. In this process, you address a vague, complex problem by breaking it down into smaller steps, and then those steps lead you to a logical 
solution.
