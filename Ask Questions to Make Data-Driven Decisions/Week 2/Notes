-> Data-inspired decision-making explores different data sources to find out what they have in common. 

-> An algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed for a specific task.

-> Quantitative data is all about the specific and objective measures of numerical facts. This can often be the what, how many, and how often about a problem. 
   In other words, things you can measure, like how many commuters take the train to work every week. 
   
   Qualitative data describes subjective or explanatory measures of qualities and characteristics or things that can't be measured with numerical data, like your 
   hair color. Qualitative data is great for helping us answer why questions. For example, why people might like a certain celebrity or snack food more than others. 
   With quantitative data, we can see numbers visualized as charts or graphs. Qualitative data can then give us a more high-level understanding of why the numbers 
   are the way they are. This is important because it helps us add context to a problem.
