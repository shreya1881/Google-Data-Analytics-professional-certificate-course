-> Data-inspired decision-making explores different data sources to find out what they have in common. 

-> An algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed for a specific task.

-> Quantitative data is all about the specific and objective measures of numerical facts. This can often be the what, how many, and how often about a problem. 
   In other words, things you can measure, like how many commuters take the train to work every week. 
   
   Qualitative data describes subjective or explanatory measures of qualities and characteristics or things that can't be measured with numerical data, like your 
   hair color. Qualitative data is great for helping us answer why questions. For example, why people might like a certain celebrity or snack food more than others. 
   With quantitative data, we can see numbers visualized as charts or graphs. Qualitative data can then give us a more high-level understanding of why the numbers 
   are the way they are. This is important because it helps us add context to a problem. 

-> QUALITATIVE DATA TOOLS
   Focus groups, Social media text analysis, In-person interviews
   
   QUANTITATIVE DATA TOOLS
   Structured Interviews, Surveys, Polls
   
-> Reports and dashboards are both useful for data visualization. But there are pros and cons for each of them. 
   A report is a static collection of data given to stakeholders periodically. 
   A dashboard on the other hand, monitors live, incoming data.
   
   REPORTS   
      1. Reports are great for giving snapshots of high level historical data for an organization. For example, a finance firm's monthly sales. Reports come with a lot of 
         benefits too.
      2. They can be designed and sent out periodically, often on a weekly or monthly basis, as organized and easy to reference information. 
      3. They're quick to design and easy to use as long as you continually maintain them. 
      4. Finally, because reports use static data or data that doesn't change once it's been recorded, they reflect data that's already been cleaned and sorted. 
      5. There are some downsides to keep in mind too. 
            - Reports need regular maintenance and aren't very visually appealing. 
            - Because they aren't automatic or dynamic, reports don't show live, evolving data. 
            
   DASHBOARDS
      1. For a live reflection of incoming data, you'll want to design a dashboard. Dashboards are great for a lot of reasons:
            - they give your team more access to information being recorded.
            - you can interact through data by playing with filters.
            - because they're dynamic, they have long-term value. 
            - nice to look at.
            - Dynamic, automatic and interactive.
            - More stakeholder access.
            - Low maintenance.
      2. Dashboards do have some cons too:
            - they take a lot of time to design and can actually be less efficient than reports, if they're not used very often.
            - If the table breaks at any point, they need a lot of maintenance to get back up and running.
            - Dashboards can sometimes overwhelm people with information too. If you aren't used to looking through data on a dashboard, you might get lost in it.
            - Labour-intensive design.
            - can be confusing.
            - potentially uncleaned data.
