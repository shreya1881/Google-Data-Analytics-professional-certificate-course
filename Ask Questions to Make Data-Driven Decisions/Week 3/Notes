      - Pivot Table: well organized and very useful tables. Sort and filter Data.
   2. Perform Calculations on your data or Calculate your data (Use formulas or functions).
         
-> In Google Sheets, users have different access privileges. As owner of the sheet, you can choose the access level for your collaborators. Click Editor in the 
   dropdown and choose the access level:

   1. Can edit — collaborators can add and edit content or comments. Choose this access level if you want them to be able to make changes to your spreadsheet.

   2. Can comment — collaborators can add comments, but can't edit content. Choose this level if you just want their feedback.

   3. Can view — collaborators can view the file, but cannot edit or add comments. Choose this level if you want to share a spreadsheet as an optional resource and 
      you don’t need feedback.         
      
-> Operators are symbols that name the type of operation or calculation to be performed. 

->  A cell reference is a single cell or range of cells in a worksheet that can be used in a formula. Cell references contain the letter of the column and the number 
    of the row where the data is. 
    
    A range of cells is a collection of two or more cells. A range can include cells from the same row or column, or from different columns and rows collected 
    together. 
 
 -> SPREADSHEET ERRORS AND FIXES
     
    1. #DIV/0! : A formula is trying to divide a value in a cell by 0 or by an ampty cell.
       To fix use IFERROR(value, [value_if_error])
