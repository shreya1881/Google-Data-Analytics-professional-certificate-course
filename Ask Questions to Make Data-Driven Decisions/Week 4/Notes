-> Stakeholders are people that have invested time, interest, and resources into the projects that you'll be working on as a data analyst. In other words, they 
   hold stakes in what you're doing. There's a good chance they'll need the work you do to perform their own needs. That's why it's so important to make sure your
   work lines up with their needs and why you need to communicate effectively with all of the stakeholders across your team. Your stakeholders will want to discuss
   things like the project objective, what you need to reach that goal, and any challenges or concerns you have. This is a good thing. These conversations help build
   trust and confidence in your work. 
   
-> You might remember that stakeholders are people who have invested time, interest, and resources into the projects that you are  working on. This can be a pretty 
   broad group, and your project stakeholders may change from project to project. But there are three common stakeholder groups that you might find yourself working
   with: the executive team, the customer-facing team, and the data science team.
   
-> EXECUTIVE TEAM
   
   The executive team provides strategic and operational leadership to the company. They set goals, develop strategy, and make sure that strategy is executed 
   effectively. The executive team might include vice presidents, the chief marketing officer, and senior-level professionals who help plan and direct the company’s
   work. These stakeholders think about decisions at a very high level and they are looking for the headline news about your project first.  They are less interested 
   in the details. Time is very limited with them, so make the most of it by leading your presentations with the answers to their questions. You can keep the more
   detailed information handy in your presentation appendix or your project documentation for them to dig into when they have more time. 
   
-> CUSTOMER FACING TEAM
   
   The customer-facing team includes anyone in an organization who has some level of interaction with customers and potential customers. Typically they compile 
   information, set expectations, and communicate customer feedback to other parts of the internal organization. These stakeholders have their own objectives and 
   may come to you with specific asks. It is important to let the data tell the story and not be swayed by asks from your stakeholders to find certain patterns that 
   might not exist.
