-> Stakeholders are people that have invested time, interest, and resources into the projects that you'll be working on as a data analyst. In other words, they 
   hold stakes in what you're doing. There's a good chance they'll need the work you do to perform their own needs. That's why it's so important to make sure your
   work lines up with their needs and why you need to communicate effectively with all of the stakeholders across your team. Your stakeholders will want to discuss
   things like the project objective, what you need to reach that goal, and any challenges or concerns you have. This is a good thing. These conversations help build
   trust and confidence in your work. 
   
-> You might remember that stakeholders are people who have invested time, interest, and resources into the projects that you are  working on. This can be a pretty 
   broad group, and your project stakeholders may change from project to project. But there are three common stakeholder groups that you might find yourself working
   with: the executive team, the customer-facing team, and the data science team.
