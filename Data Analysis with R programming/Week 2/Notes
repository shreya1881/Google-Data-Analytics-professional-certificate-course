-> Functions are a body of reusable code used to perform specific tasks in R. Functions begin with function names like print or paste, and are usually followed by one
   or more arguments in parentheses. An argument is information that a function in R needs in order to run. 

-> A variable is a representation of a value in R that can be stored for use later during programming. Variables can also be called objects. As a data analyst, you'll
   find variables are very useful when programming. 
   
-> A pipe is a tool in R for expressing a sequence of multiple operations. A pipe is represented by a % sign, followed by a > sign, and another % sign. It's used to 
   apply the output of one function into another function. Pipes can make your code easier to read and understand. 
   
-> Fundamentals of R programming:
   1. Functions
   2. Comments
   3. Variables
   4. Vectors
   5. Pipe
   6. Data Types

->  The most common data structures in the R programming language include: 

      Vectors

      Data frames

      Matrices

      Arrays

-> Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables and vectors.
   
   Arithmetic operators. These operators are used to complete math calculations and they might seem familiar. Plus signs do addition on variables, and minus signs 
   do subtraction. We use an asterisk to perform multiplication and a slash performs division.

-> One of the most commonly used sources of packages is CRAN. CRAN stands for Comprehensive R Archives Network. It's an online archive with R packages, source code,
   manuals and documentation.
