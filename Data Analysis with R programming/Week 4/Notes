-> General-purpose packages like Plotly let you do a wide range of visualization functions. Others like RGL, focus on specific solutions like 3D visuals. Some of the
   most popular include ggplot2, Plotly, Lattice, RGL, Dygraphs, Leaflet, Highcharter, Patchwork, gganimate and ggridges. 

-> So ggplot2 has some basic building blocks that you can use to create plots. In other words when you learn the basic steps for creating a plot in ggplot2, you can 
   reuse these steps to create lots of different kinds of plots. Plus, you can add or remove layers of detail to your plot without changing its basic structure or 
   the underlying data. This makes ggplot2 really powerful. In the next video, we'll go over these steps one by one. Ggplot2 has lots of other benefits too. You can 
   create all different types of plots including scatter plots, bar charts, line diagrams and tons more. You can change the colors, layout and dimensions of your 
   plots and add text elements like titles, captions and labels. With just a little bit of code you can create high-quality visuals. Plus ggplot2 lets you combine 
   data manipulation and visualization using the pipe operator. Ggplot2 also has tons of functions that cover all your data viz needs. To give you an idea, check out 
   the ggplot2 cheat sheet, which is a popular reference guide. You can find out more about the ggplot2 cheat sheet in an upcoming reading.

-> core concepts in ggplot2: aesthetics, geoms, facets, labels and annotations. These might be new concepts to you and that's okay. 

-> In ggplot2 an aesthetic is a visual property of an object in your plot. For example, in a scatter plot aesthetics include things like the size, shape or color of 
   your data points. Think of an aesthetic as a connection or mapping between a visual feature in your plot and a variable in your data. We'll talk more about mapping 
   later on.
   
   A geom refers to the geometric object used to represent your data. For example, you can use points to create a scatter plot, bars to create a bar chart, or lines
   to create a line diagram. You can choose a geom to fit the type of data you have. Points show the relationship between two quantitative variables. Bars show one 
   quantitative variable varies across different categories. 
   
-> Facets let you display smaller groups or subsets of your data. With facets, you can create separate plots for all the variables in your dataset.

-> Mapping means matching up a specific variable in your dataset with a specific aesthetic.

-> To create a plot, follow these three steps: start with the ggplot function and choose a dataset to work with, add a geom_function to display your data, map the 
   variables you want to plot in the argument of the aes function. We can also turn our code into a reusable template for creating plots in ggplot2. To make a plot, 
   replace the bracketed sections in the code with a dataset, a geom_function, or a group of aesthetic mappings.
