-> R Markdown is a file format for making dynamic documents with R. You can use an R Markdown file as a code notebook to save, organize, and document your analysis
   using code chunks, comments, and other features. When you finish your data cleaning and exploration, you can create a report in R Markdown to summarize your 
   findings for stakeholders.
   
-> HTML is the set of markup symbols and codes used to create a web page. R Markdown has the most available features for this format, but you can get good results 
   in any of the formats. 

-> YAML is a language for data that translates it, so it's readable. Fun fact: YAML originally stood for yet another markup language. This section is called out 
   using three dashes on the first and last lines. This syntax automatically creates the YAML header section when it's used in an RMD file. In an RMD file, this 
   section's basically for metadata or the data about the data in the rest of the file.
