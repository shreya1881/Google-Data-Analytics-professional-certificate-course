-> Difference between data scientists and data analysts. 
   It's easy to confuse the two, but what they do is actually very different. Data science is defined as creating new ways of modeling and understanding the 
   unknown by using raw data. Here's a good way to think about it. Data scientists create new questions using data, while analysts find answers to existing 
   questions by creating insights from data sources.
   
-> Difference between Data analysis and Data analytics.
   Data analysis is the collection, transformation, and organization of data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed 
   decision-making. Data analytics in the simplest terms is the science of data. It's a very broad concept that encompasses everything from the job of 
   managing and using data to the tools and methods that data workers use each and every day.
