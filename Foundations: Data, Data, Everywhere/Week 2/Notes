   KEY ANALYTICAL SKILLS

-> Curiosity is all about wanting to learn something. Curious people usually seek out new challenges and experiences. This leads to knowledge.
   
   Context is the condition in which something exists or happens. This can be a structure or an environment.
   
   A technical mindset involves the ability to break things down into smaller steps or pieces and work with them in an orderly and logical way.
   
   Data design is how you organize information. As a data analyst, design typically has to do with an actual database. But, again, the same skills can easily be 
   applied to everyday life.
