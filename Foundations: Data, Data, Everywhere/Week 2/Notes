-> Analytical skills are qualities and characteristics associated with solving problems using facts.

-> Five essential points with respect to analytical skills are curiosity, understanding context, having technical mindset, data design, and data strategy. 

   KEY ANALYTICAL SKILLS

-> Curiosity is all about wanting to learn something. Curious people usually seek out new challenges and experiences. This leads to knowledge.
   
   Context is the condition in which something exists or happens. This can be a structure or an environment.
   
   A technical mindset involves the ability to break things down into smaller steps or pieces and work with them in an orderly and logical way.
   
   Data design is how you organize information. As a data analyst, design typically has to do with an actual database. But, again, the same skills can easily be 
   applied to everyday life.
   
   Data strategy is the management of the people, processes, and tools used in data analysis.
   
   ANALYTICAL THINKING
   
-> Analytical thinking involves identifying and defining a problem and then solving it by using data in an organized, step-by-step manner.
   
   FIVE KEY ASPECTS TO ANALYTICAL THINKING
   
-> visualization, strategy, problem-orientation, correlation, big-picture and detail-oriented thinking.

-> Visualization is the graphical representation of information. Some examples include graphs, maps, charts, or other design elements. Visualization is 
   important because visuals can help data analysts understand and explain information more effectively.
   
   The second part of analytical thinking is being strategic. With so much data available, having a strategic mindset is key to staying focused and on track. 
   Strategizing helps data analysts see what they want to achieve with the data and how they can get there. Strategy also helps improve the quality and 
   usefulness of the data we collect. By strategizing, we know all our data is valuable and can help us accomplish our goals. 
   
   Being problem-oriented. Data analysts use a problem-oriented approach in order to identify, describe, and solve problems. It's all about keeping the problem 
   at top of mind throughout the entire project.
