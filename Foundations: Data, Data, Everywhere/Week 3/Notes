LIFE CYCLE OF DATA

Plan, Capture, Manage, Analyze, Archive and Destroy.

->  Planning: This actually happens well before starting an analysis project. During planning, a business decides what kind of data it needs, how it will be 
    managed throughout its life cycle, who will be responsible for it, and the optimal outcomes.
    
    Capture data: This is where data is collected from a variety of different sources and brought into the organization. With so much data being created everyday, 
    the ways to collect it are truly endless. 
    One common method is getting data from outside resources.
    Another way to get data is from a company's own documents and files, which are usually stored inside a database. A database is a collection of data stored in a 
    computer system.
    
    Manage: Here we're talking about how we care for our data, how and where it's stored, the tools used to keep it safe and secure, and the actions taken to 
    make sure that it's maintained properly. This phase is very important to data cleansing.
    
    Analyze your data: This is where data analysts really shine. In this phase, the data is used to solve problems, make great decisions, and support business goals.
    
    Archive phase: Archiving means storing data in a place where it's still available, but may not be used again. During analysis, analysts handle huge amounts 
    of data. Can you imagine if we had to sort through all of the available data that's out there, even if it was no longer useful and relevant to our work? 
    It makes way more sense to archive it than to keep it around.
    
    Destroy phase. Yes, it sounds sad, but when you destroy data, it won't hurt a bit. So let's get back to our electricity provider example. They would have 
    data stored on multiple hard drives. To destroy it, the company would use a secure data erasure software. If there were any paper files, they would be shredded too.
    This is important for protecting a company's private information, as well as private data about its customers.
