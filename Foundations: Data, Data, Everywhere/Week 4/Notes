MASTERING SPREADSHEETS BASICS

-> Introduced to the basic terms: Cell, COlumn, Row
-> Cell is defined by column alphabet followed by number. Example: A3, D2 etc.

-> For Example: you are writing your name in a cell and the name does not fit completely, You can drag the column to adjust its width by the right edge. You can also
   use the text wrap option where in you select the column, then go to format and go to text wrap. There are three options: Overfit, Wrap, Clip.
   Overfit is default- it wont show the entire word.
   Wrap will automatically adjust the column width according to the length of the word.
   The clip option will cut off the text in the cell so only the text that fits is visible.
