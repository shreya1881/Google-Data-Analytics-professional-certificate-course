MASTERING SPREADSHEETS BASICS

-> Introduced to the basic terms: Cell, COlumn, Row
-> Cell is defined by column alphabet followed by number. Example: A3, D2 etc.

-> For Example: you are writing your name in a cell and the name does not fit completely, You can drag the column to adjust its width by the right edge. You can also
   use the text wrap option where in you select the column, then go to format and go to text wrap. There are three options: Overfit, Wrap, Clip.
   Overfit is default- it wont show the entire word.
   Wrap will automatically adjust the column width according to the length of the word.
   The clip option will cut off the text in the cell so only the text that fits is visible.
   
-> One should always label the columns. Adding labels to the top of the columns will make it easier to reference and find data later on when you're doing analysis. 
   These column labels are usually called attributes. An attribute is a characteristic or quality of data used to label a column in a table.
   More commonly, attributes are referred to as column names, column labels, headers, or the header row. 
   
-> In a dataset, a row is also called an observation. An observation includes all of the attributes for something contained in a row of a data table.

-> Example:  Let's say we want to organize our data by how many siblings each person has. There's a simple way to do that. First, we'll need to select all of our 
   columns with data so that all of it is reorganized together. Then we can go to our data menu. Here we have some options. Let's select sort range. This will let
   us choose how to organize the column. Next, we'll choose A to Z, which will organize our numbers in order from smallest to largest. Now, we want to watch out 
   for header row, which is the word siblings, the attribute for this column. We'll check this box. This makes sure the word siblings stays in place. 
   Now we're ready to sort. Voila, we just reorganized our data by sorting it from the smallest number to the largest.
   
-> Formulas are like a calculator, but more powerful. A formula is a set of instructions that performs a specific action using the data in a spreadsheet. 
   To do this, the formula uses cell references for the values it's calculating.

SQL: STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE

-> SQL can do lots of the same things with data that spreadsheets can do. You can use it to store, organize and analyze your data, among other things.

-> A query is a request for data or information from a database. With this query, we can select specific data from the table and filter the data based on
   certain conditions.

-> Every programming language, including SQL, follows a unique set of guidelines known as syntax. Syntax is the predetermined structure of a language that
   includes all required words, symbols, and punctuation, as well as their proper placement. 
   
-> The syntax of every SQL query is the same: 

   Use SELECT to choose the columns you want to return.

   Use FROM to choose the tables where the columns you want are located.

   Use WHERE to filter for certain information.
   
-> You can also make it easier on yourself by assigning a new name or alias to the column or table names to make them easier to work with (and avoid the need for 
   comments). This is done with a SQL AS clause. In the example below, the alias last_name has been assigned to field1 and the alias customers assigned to table. 
   These aliases are good for the duration of the query only. An alias doesnâ€™t change the actual name of a column or table in the database.
