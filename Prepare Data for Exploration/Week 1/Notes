-> After asking the correct questions, you need to prepare the data correctly.

-> Process: preparing the data correctly. 
   This is where understanding the different types of data and data structures comes in. Knowing this lets you figure out what type of data is right for the question 
   you're answering. Plus, you'll gain practical skills about how to extract, use, organize, and protect your data.

-> HOW DATA IS COLLECTED
      1. Interviews
      2. Observations
      3. Forms
      4. Questionnaires
      5. Surveys
      6. Cookies
      
-> First-party data: This is data collected by an individual or group using their own resources.

   Second-party data: which is data collected by a group directly from its audience and then sold. 
   
   Third-party data: data collected from outside sources who did not collect it directly. This data might have come from a number of different sources before you 
   investigated it. It might not be as reliable, but that doesn't mean it can't be useful. You'll just want to make sure you check it for accuracy, bias, and
   credibility.
   
-> No matter what kind of data you use, it needs to be inspected for accuracy and trustworthiness. 

-> Data collection considerations:
      1. How thw data will be collected?
      2. Choose data sources
      3. Decide what data to use
      4. How much data to collect
      5. Select the right/correct data type
      6. Determine the time frame

->  A sample is a part of a population that is representative of the population.

-> Qualitative data : it can't be counted, measured, or easily expressed using numbers. Qualitative data is usually listed as a name, category, or description. 

   Quantitative data : which can be measured or counted and then expressed as a number. This is data with a certain quantity, amount, or range.
   
-> Quantitative data can be broken down into discrete or continuous data. 
      1. Discrete Data: data that's counted and has a limited number of values. Discrete data isn't limited to dollar amounts. Examples of other discrete data 
         are stars and points. When partial measurements (half-stars or quarter-points) aren't allowed, the data is discrete. If you don't accept anything other 
         than full stars or points, the data is considered discrete.
      2. Continuous data : It can be measured using a timer, and its value can be shown as a decimal with several places.
