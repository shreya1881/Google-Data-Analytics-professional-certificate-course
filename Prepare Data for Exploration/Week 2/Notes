-> Bias has evolved to become a preference in favor of or against a person, group of people, or thing. It can be conscious or subconscious. The good news is once we 
   know and accept that we have bias, we can start to recognize our own patterns of thinking and learn how to manage it. 
   It's important to know that bias can also find its way into the world of data. 

-> Data bias is a type of error that systematically skews results in a certain direction. 

-> Sampling bias is when a sample isn't representative of the population as a whole. You can avoid this by making sure the sample is chosen at random, so that all 
   parts of the population have an equal chance of being included. If you don't use random sampling during data collection, you end up favoring one outcome.
   
-> Unbiased sampling results in a sample that's representative of the population being measured. Another great way to discover if you're working with unbiased data 
   is to bring the results to life with visualizations.
   
-> TYPES OF DATA BIAS:
      1. Sampling bias
      2. Observer Bias
      3. Interpretation bias
      4. Confirmation bias

-> Observer bias: Sometimes referred to as experimenter bias or research bias. Basically, it's the tendency for different people to observe things differently.

-> Interpretation bias: The tendency to always interpret ambiguous situations in a positive, or negative way. Interpretation bias, can lead to two people seeing or 
   hearing the exact same thing, and interpreting it in a variety of different ways, because they have different backgrounds, and experiences. 

-> Confirmation bias, is the tendency to search for, or interpret information in a way that confirms preexisting beliefs. Someone might be so eager to confirm a gut 
   feeling, that they only notice things that support it, ignoring all other signals. This happens all the time in everyday life. 

-> ROCCC, R-O-C-C-C. This is a method to identify good data resources. 
   
   R for reliable. Like a good friend, good data sources are reliable. With this data you can trust that you're getting accurate, complete and unbiased information 
   that's been vetted and proven fit for use. 
   
   Onto O. O is for original. There's a good chance you'll discover data through a second or third party source. To make sure you're dealing with good data, 
   be sure to validate it with the original source. 
   
   Time for the first C. C is for comprehensive. The best data sources contain all critical information needed to answer the question or find the solution. 
   Think about it like this. You wouldn't want to work for a company just because you found one great online review about it. You'd research every aspect 
   of the organization to make sure it was the right fit. It's important to do the same for your data analysis. 
   
   The next C is for current. The usefulness of data decreases as time passes. If you wanted to invite all current clients to a business event, you wouldn't
   use a 10-year-old client list. The same goes for data. The best data sources are current and relevant to the task at hand. 
   
   The last C is for cited. If you've ever told a friend where you heard that a new movie sequel was in the works, you've cited a source. Citing makes the
   information you're providing more credible. 
   
   When you're choosing a data source, think about three things. Who created the data set? Is it part of a credible organization? When was the data last refreshed? 
   If you have original data from a reliable organization and it's comprehensive, current, and cited, it ROCCCs!
