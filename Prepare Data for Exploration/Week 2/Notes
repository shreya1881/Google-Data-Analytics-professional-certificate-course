-> Bias has evolved to become a preference in favor of or against a person, group of people, or thing. It can be conscious or subconscious. The good news is once we 
   know and accept that we have bias, we can start to recognize our own patterns of thinking and learn how to manage it. 
   It's important to know that bias can also find its way into the world of data. 

-> Data bias is a type of error that systematically skews results in a certain direction. 

-> Sampling bias is when a sample isn't representative of the population as a whole. You can avoid this by making sure the sample is chosen at random, so that all 
   parts of the population have an equal chance of being included. If you don't use random sampling during data collection, you end up favoring one outcome.
   
-> Unbiased sampling results in a sample that's representative of the population being measured. Another great way to discover if you're working with unbiased data 
   is to bring the results to life with visualizations.
   
-> TYPES OF DATA BIAS:
      1. Sampling bias
      2. Observer Bias
      3. Interpretation bias
      4. Confirmation bias

-> Observer bias: Sometimes referred to as experimenter bias or research bias. Basically, it's the tendency for different people to observe things differently.
