-> Bias has evolved to become a preference in favor of or against a person, group of people, or thing. It can be conscious or subconscious. The good news is once we 
   know and accept that we have bias, we can start to recognize our own patterns of thinking and learn how to manage it. 
   It's important to know that bias can also find its way into the world of data. 

-> Data bias is a type of error that systematically skews results in a certain direction. 

-> Sampling bias is when a sample isn't representative of the population as a whole. You can avoid this by making sure the sample is chosen at random, so that all 
   parts of the population have an equal chance of being included. If you don't use random sampling during data collection, you end up favoring one outcome.
   
-> Unbiased sampling results in a sample that's representative of the population being measured. Another great way to discover if you're working with unbiased data 
   is to bring the results to life with visualizations.
   
-> TYPES OF DATA BIAS:
      1. Sampling bias
      2. Observer Bias
      3. Interpretation bias
      4. Confirmation bias

-> Observer bias: Sometimes referred to as experimenter bias or research bias. Basically, it's the tendency for different people to observe things differently.

-> Interpretation bias: The tendency to always interpret ambiguous situations in a positive, or negative way. Interpretation bias, can lead to two people seeing or 
   hearing the exact same thing, and interpreting it in a variety of different ways, because they have different backgrounds, and experiences. 

-> Confirmation bias, is the tendency to search for, or interpret information in a way that confirms preexisting beliefs. Someone might be so eager to confirm a gut 
   feeling, that they only notice things that support it, ignoring all other signals. This happens all the time in everyday life. 

-> ROCCC, R-O-C-C-C. This is a method to identify good data resources. 
   
   R for reliable. Like a good friend, good data sources are reliable. With this data you can trust that you're getting accurate, complete and unbiased information 
   that's been vetted and proven fit for use. 
   
   Onto O. O is for original. There's a good chance you'll discover data through a second or third party source. To make sure you're dealing with good data, 
   be sure to validate it with the original source. 
   
   Time for the first C. C is for comprehensive. The best data sources contain all critical information needed to answer the question or find the solution. 
   Think about it like this. You wouldn't want to work for a company just because you found one great online review about it. You'd research every aspect 
   of the organization to make sure it was the right fit. It's important to do the same for your data analysis. 
   
   The next C is for current. The usefulness of data decreases as time passes. If you wanted to invite all current clients to a business event, you wouldn't
   use a 10-year-old client list. The same goes for data. The best data sources are current and relevant to the task at hand. 
   
   The last C is for cited. If you've ever told a friend where you heard that a new movie sequel was in the works, you've cited a source. Citing makes the
   information you're providing more credible. 
   
   When you're choosing a data source, think about three things. Who created the data set? Is it part of a credible organization? When was the data last refreshed? 
   If you have original data from a reliable organization and it's comprehensive, current, and cited, it ROCCCs!
   
-> Bad data sources that don't follow ROCCC. They're not reliable, original, comprehensive, current or cited. Even worse, they could be flat-out wrong or 
   filled with human error. We'll start again with R. R is for not reliable. Bad data can't be trusted because it's inaccurate, incomplete, or biased. 
   This could be data that has sample selection bias because it doesn't reflect the overall population. Or it could be data visualizations and graphs that 
   are just misleading.
   
   O is for not original. If you can't locate the original data source and you're just relying on second or third party information, that can signal you may need 
   to be extra careful in understanding your data.
   
   Now, C is for not comprehensive. Bad data sources are missing important information needed to answer the question or find the solution. What's worse, they may 
   contain human error, too.
   
   The next C is for not current. Bad data sources are out of date and irrelevant. Many respected sources refresh their data regularly, giving you confidence 
   that it's the most current info available. 
   
   The last C is for not cited. If your source hasn't been cited or vetted, it's a no-go. So to sum up, good data should be original data from a reliable
   organization, comprehensive, current, and cited. It should ROCCC! Otherwise, it's bad data.

-> Ethics refers to well-founded standards of right and wrong that prescribe what humans ought to do, usually in terms of rights, obligations, benefits to society, 
   fairness or specific virtues. Just like humans, data has standards to live up to as well. 
   
   Data ethics refers to well- founded standards of right and wrong that dictate how data is collected, shared, and used. Since the ability to collect, 
   share and use data in such large quantities is relatively new, the rules that regulate and govern the process are still evolving. The importance of 
   data privacy has been recognized by governments worldwide and they started creating data protection legislation to help protect people and their data. 
   
   The GDPR of the European Union was created to do just this.
