-> A database is a collection of data stored in a computer system, but storage is just the beginning. 

-> Metadata is data about data. Like I said: deep.
   Metadata is extremely important when working with databases. Think of it like a reference guide. Without the guide all you have is a bunch of data with no context
   explaining what it means. Metadata tells you where the data comes from, when and how it was created, and what it's all about.
