-> A database is a collection of data stored in a computer system, but storage is just the beginning. 

-> Metadata is data about data. Like I said: deep.
   Metadata is extremely important when working with databases. Think of it like a reference guide. Without the guide all you have is a bunch of data with no context
   explaining what it means. Metadata tells you where the data comes from, when and how it was created, and what it's all about.

-> A relational database is a database that contains a series of related tables that can be connected via their relationships. For two tables to have a relationship, 
   one or more of the same fields must exist inside both tables.

-> There are two types of keys:
      1. Primary Key: A primary key is an identifier that references a column in which each value is unique. You can think of it as a unique identifier for each row 
         in a table. If you do decide to include a primary key, it should be unique, meaning no two rows can have the same primary key. It cannot be null or blank.
      2. Foreign Key: A foreign key is a field within a table that's a primary key in another table. In other words, a foreign key is how one table can be connected to 
         another.

-> A table can only have one primary key but it can have multiple foreign keys. 

-> A primary key is used to ensure data in a specific column is unique. It uniquely identifies a record in a relational database table. Only one primary key is 
   allowed in a table and they cannot contain null or blank values. 
   And a foreign key is a column or group of columns in a relational database table that provides a link between the data and two tables. It refers to the field in a 
   table that's the primary key of another table. Lastly, it's important to note that more than one foreign key is allowed to exist in a table.
