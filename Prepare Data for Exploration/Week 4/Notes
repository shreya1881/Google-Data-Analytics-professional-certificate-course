-> Keeping your data organized is important for a few reasons; it makes it easier to find and use, helps you avoid making mistakes during your analysis and helps to 
   protect it.

-> Naming conventions. These are consistent guidelines that describe the content, date, or version of a file in its name. Basically, this means you want to use 
   logical and descriptive names for your files to make them easier to find and use. 

-> There are two more things you'll want to consider when organizing data for work use. First, the project data you'll be using for work could be accessed and used 
   by multiple people. It's important to align your naming and storage practices with your team to avoid any confusion. Your team might also develop metadata 
   practices like creating a file that outlines project naming conventions for easy reference. 

-> Secondly, you want to think about how often you're making copies of data and storing it in different places. Most importantly, because if data is stored in lots 
   of different databases or spreadsheets, it can contradict itself and lead to mistakes later on. Also storing data in multiple places takes up a lot of space. 
   Relational databases can help you avoid data duplication and store your data more efficiently.
