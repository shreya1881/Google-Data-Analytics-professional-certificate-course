-> A professional online presence is important for a few key reasons. First, it can help potential employers find you. Second, it lets you make connections with 
   other data analysts in your field, learn and share data findings, and maybe even participate in community events.

-> Networking can be called professional relationship building. It's all about meeting people both on and offline and building relationships with them. Networking 
   will help you meet people who are similar and different from you and also stay current with what's going on in your fields. Even within the organization you're in, 
   you want to network with other teams to better understand the projects you're working on.
