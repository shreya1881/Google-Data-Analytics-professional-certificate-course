-> A strong analysis depends on the integrity of the data. If the data you're using is compromised in any way, your analysis won't be as strong as it should be.

-> Data integrity is the accuracy, completeness, consistency, and trustworthiness of data throughout its lifecycle.

-> When data integrity is low, it can cause anything from the loss of a single pixel in an image to an incorrect medical decision. In some cases, one missing piece 
   can make all of your data useless.

-> Data integrity can be compromised in lots of different ways. There's a chance data can be compromised every time it's replicated, transferred, or manipulated in 
   any way.
