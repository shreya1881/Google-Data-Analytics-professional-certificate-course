   1. Duplicate data - Any data record that shows up more than once.
   2. Outdated data - Any data that is old which should be replaced with newer and more accurate information.
   3. Incomplete data - Any data that is missing important fields.
   4. Incorrect/inaccurate data - Any data that is complete but inaccurate.
   5. Inconsistent data - Any data that uses different formats to represent the same thing.
