-> SQL is a structured query language that analysts use to work with databases. Data analysts usually use SQL to deal with large datasets because it can handle huge 
   amounts of data.

-> Relational databses: This is a database that contains a series of tables that can be connected to form relationships. 

-> FEATURES OF SPREADSHEETS:
   1. Smaller data sets
   2. Enter data manually.
   3. Creates graphs and visualizations in the same program.
   4. Built-in spell check and other useful functions.
   5. Best when working solo on a project.
   
-> FEATURES OF SQL DATABASES:
   1. Large datasets.
   2. Access tables across a database.
   3. Prepare data for further analysis in another software.
   4. Fast and powerful functionality.
   5. Great for collaborative work and tracking queries run by all users.

-> SPREADSHEETS
   1. Generated with a program.
   2. Access to the data you input.
   3. Stored locally
   
-> SQL
   1. A language used to interact with database programs.
   2. Can pull information from different sources in the database.
   3. Stored across a database.
   
-> Data is measured by the number of bits it takes to represent it. All information in a computer can be represented as a binary number consisting solely of 0’s and 
   1’s. Each 0 or 1 in a number is a bit. A bit is the smallest unit of storage in computers. Since computers work in binary (Base 2), this means that all the 
   important numbers that differentiate between different data sizes will be powers of 2.  

   A byte is a collection of 8 bits. Take a moment to examine the table below to get a feel for the difference between data measurements and their relative sizes to 
   one another.
