-> Verification is a process to confirm that a data cleaning effort was well- executed and the resulting data is accurate and reliable. It involves rechecking your 
   clean dataset, doing some manual clean ups if needed, and taking a moment to sit back and really think about the original purpose of the project. That way, you 
   can be confident that the data you collected is credible and appropriate for your purposes. 
   
   Making sure your data is properly verified is so important because it allows you to double-check that the work you did to clean up your data was thorough and 
   accurate.

-> Open communication is a lifeline for any data analytics project. Reports are a super effective way to show your team that you're being 100 percent transparent
   about your data cleaning. Reporting is also a great opportunity to show stakeholders that you're accountable, build trust with your team, and make sure you're 
   all on the same page of important project details. 
   Different strategies for reporting, include, creating data- cleaning reports, documenting your cleaning process, and using something called the changelog. 
   
-> A changelog is a file containing a chronologically ordered list of modifications made to a project. It's usually organized by version and includes the date
  followed by a list of added, improved, and removed features. Changelogs are very useful for keeping track of how a dataset evolved over the course of a project. 
  They're also another great way to communicate and report on data to others. 

-> The first step in the verification process is going back to your original unclean data set and comparing it to what you have now. Review the dirty data and try
   to identify any common problems.
