-> Verification is a process to confirm that a data cleaning effort was well- executed and the resulting data is accurate and reliable. It involves rechecking your 
   clean dataset, doing some manual clean ups if needed, and taking a moment to sit back and really think about the original purpose of the project. That way, you 
   can be confident that the data you collected is credible and appropriate for your purposes. 
   
   Making sure your data is properly verified is so important because it allows you to double-check that the work you did to clean up your data was thorough and 
   accurate.

-> Open communication is a lifeline for any data analytics project. Reports are a super effective way to show your team that you're being 100 percent transparent
   about your data cleaning. Reporting is also a great opportunity to show stakeholders that you're accountable, build trust with your team, and make sure you're 
   all on the same page of important project details. 
   Different strategies for reporting, include, creating data- cleaning reports, documenting your cleaning process, and using something called the changelog. 
   
-> A changelog is a file containing a chronologically ordered list of modifications made to a project. It's usually organized by version and includes the date
  followed by a list of added, improved, and removed features. Changelogs are very useful for keeping track of how a dataset evolved over the course of a project. 
  They're also another great way to communicate and report on data to others. 

-> The first step in the verification process is going back to your original unclean data set and comparing it to what you have now. Review the dirty data and try
   to identify any common problems. 

-> Another key part of verification involves taking a big-picture view of your project. This is an opportunity to confirm you're actually focusing on the business 
   problem that you need to solve and the overall project goals and to make sure that your data is actually capable of solving that problem and achieving those goals.
   It's important to take the time to reset and focus on the big picture because projects can sometimes evolve or transform over time without us even realizing it.

-> Taking a big picture view of your project involves doing three things. First, consider the business problem you're trying to solve with the data.
   If you've lost sight of the problem, you have no way of knowing what data belongs in your analysis. Taking a problem-first approach to analytics is essential at 
   all stages of any project. You need to be certain that your data will actually make it possible to solve your business problem. 
   
   Second, you need to consider the goal of the project. It's not enough just to know that your company wants to analyze customer feedback about a product. 
   What you really need to know is that the goal of getting this feedback is to make improvements to that product. On top of that, you also need to know whether the
   data you've collected and cleaned will actually help your company achieve that goal. 
   
   And third, you need to consider whether your data is capable of solving the problem and meeting the project objectives. That means thinking about where the data 
   came from and testing your data collection and cleaning processes.

-> Find and replace. Find and replace is a tool that looks for a specified search term in a spreadsheet and allows you to replace it with something else.
