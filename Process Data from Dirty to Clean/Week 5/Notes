   Format your resume

   First, you’ll make some decisions about the structure and layout of your resume. You’ll start by examining the two templates and decide which format you like best.
   Spend some time browsing the templates, as well as templates available to you on the web. Take note of the things you like or dislike about the various formats. 
   It’s okay to take some time and be selective here. You’ll be spending a lot of time on this document, so picking a format you’re happy with will help you get off
   to a strong start. 


   Formats and templates

   Before creating your resume, you need to make some design decisions. While you may make some small tweaks and changes to tailor the content of your resume to
   specific roles you are applying for, the structure and format of the resume likely won’t change. This means it is important to spend time thinking about how 
   you’ll want to structure your resume.  


   Keep your resume format concise


   There’s no “best” format for a resume. Instead, think about what you want to highlight about yourself to potential employers. 

   For instance, if you have relevant work experience, then pick a format to highlight that. 

   If you are transitioning from a different career and don’t yet have relevant work experience, then you may want to pick a format that highlights your technical
   skills and portfolio projects. Some resume formats include a Summary or Goals section at the top to help candidates add context to their application, while other
   resume formats avoid these sections completely and save that space for sections such as Skills and Experience.  

   Whatever format you pick, make sure to follow the one-page rule and keep the completed version on just a single page. If the one-page rule seems limiting, think 
   about the purpose resumes serve in the hiring process overall. Resumes are short documents designed to communicate the most pertinent information about yourself 
   to recruiters and hiring managers at a glance. These are different from longer, multi-page Curriculum Vitaes (CVs) that exhaustively list every relevant thing 
   the candidate has ever done. 

   If an employer wants a detailed history of your past work experiences and accolades, they might specifically request a CV (curriculum vitae) instead. If they
   don’t, always assume they prefer a resume. While it is generally considered acceptable for resumes of applicants with extensive work history applying for senior
   technical roles to have two-page resumes, these are the exception rather than the rule. When applying for a data analyst position, keep it to one page! 


   Select a format
   Once you decide on a template, resist the urge to begin filling it out. The next lessons will focus on best practices for communicating your skills and 
   experience in meaningful, impactful ways. Keep this resume template handy, as you’ll be working on it further.
