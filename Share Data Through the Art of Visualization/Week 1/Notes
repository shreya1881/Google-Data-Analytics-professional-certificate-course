-> Data Analytics is the collection and analysis and then use of data to tell stories, using charts and visualizations, so that businesses can make better decisions. 

-> Data visualization is the graphic representation and presentation of data. In reality, it's just putting information into an image to make it easier for other 
   people to understand.

-> Today we can quantify human behavior through data, and we've learned to use computers to collect, analyze and visualize that data. As an analyst in today's world, 
   you'll probably split your time with data visuals in two ways: looking at visuals in order to understand and draw conclusions about data or creating visuals from 
   raw data to tell a story. 

-> Four elements of effective data visualization are: Information(data), Story(concept), goal(function), visual form(story).
   
   Information: the data you are working with

   Story: a clear and compelling narrative or concept

   Goal: a specific objective or function for the visual

   Visual form: an effective use of metaphor or visual expression
   
-> Pre-attentive attributes are the elements of a data visualization that people recognize automatically without conscious effort. The essential, basic building 
   blocks that make visuals immediately understandable are called marks and channels. Marks, Size, Shape, Colour.
   
   Channels are visual aspects or variables that represent characteristics of the data. Channels are basically marks that have been used to visualize data. Accuracy,
   popout, grouping.

-> Bar graphs use size contrast to compare two or more values. The horizontal line of a bar graph usually placed at the bottom, is called the x-axis, and bar graphs 
   with vertical bars, the x-axis is used to represent categories, time periods, or other variables. The vertical line of a bar graph usually placed to the left is
   called the y-axis. The y-axis usually has a scale of values for the variables. In this example, the time of day is compared to someone's level of motivation 
   throughout the whole workday. Bar graphs are a great way to clarify trends. 
   
-> Line graphs are a type of visualization that can help your audience understand shifts or changes in your data. They're usually used to track changes through a
   period of time, but they can be paired with other factors too.

-> Pie charts show how much each part of something makes up the whole. 

-> Pie charts show proportions and percentages between categories. Each part of the circle or pi should reflect its percentage to the whole, which is equal to 
   100 percent.

-> One of your biggest considerations when creating a data visualization is where you'd like your audience to focus. Showing too much can be distracting and leave
   your audience confused. In some cases, restricting data can be a good thing. On the other hand, showing too little can make your visualization unclear and less
   meaningful. As a general rule, as long as it's not misleading, you should visually represent only the data that your audience needs in order to understand your 
   findings.
   
   what you can show with visualizations. Change over time is a big one. If your analysis involves how the data has changed over a certain period, which could be
   days, weeks, months, or years. You can set your visualization to show only the time period relevant to your objective.
   
->  A histogram resembles a bar graph, but it's a chart that shows how often data values fall into certain ranges. This histogram shows a lot of data and how it's
   distributed on a narrow range from a negative one to a positive one. Each bin or bucket, as the bar is called, contains a certain number of values that fall 
   into one small part of the range.

-> Correlation charts can show relationships among data, but they should be used with caution because they might lead viewers to think that the data shows causation.
   Causation or a cause-effect relationship occurs when an action directly leads to an outcome. Correlation and causation are often mixed up because humans like
   to find patterns even when they don't exist. If two variables look like they're associated in some way, we might assume that one is dependent on the other. 
   That implies causation, even if the variables are completely independent. If we put that data into a visualization, then it would be misleading.
   But correlation charts that do show causation can be effective.
   
-> Correlation in statistics is the measure of the degree to which two variables move in relationship to each other. An example of correlation is the idea that 
   “As the temperature goes up, ice cream sales also go up.” It is important to remember that correlation doesn’t mean that one event causes another. But, it does
   indicate that they have a pattern with or a relationship to each other. If one variable goes up and the other variable also goes up, it is a positive correlation.
   If one variable goes up and the other variable goes down, it is a negative or inverse correlation. If one variable goes up and the other variable stays about the
   same, there is no correlation.
   
   Causation refers to the idea that an event leads to a specific outcome. For example, when lightning strikes, we hear the thunder (sound wave) caused by the air
   heating and cooling from the lightning strike. Lightning causes thunder.  
   
-> Static visualizations do not change over time unless they're edited. They can be useful when you want to control your data and your data story. Any visualization
   printed on paper is automatically static. Charts and graphs created in spreadsheets are often static too.
   
   dynamic visualizations are interactive or change over time. The interactive nature of these graphics means that users have some control over what they see. This
   can be helpful if stakeholders want to adjust what they're able to view.
   
-> A decision tree is a decision-making tool that allows you, the data analyst, to make decisions based on key questions that you can ask yourself. Each question 
   in the visualization decision tree will help you make a decision about critical features for your visualization.

->  Lines and visualizations can be curved or straight, thick or thin, vertical, horizontal, or diagonal. They can add visual form to your data and help build a 
   structure for your visualization. These charts show some of the variety that lines can bring to your data viz. The combo chart shows two different types of 
   lines, both providing a graphic for the data. The line chart does the same, but uses curved lines instead. Shapes are also known for their variety. 
   
   Shapes and visualizations should always be two-dimensional. This is because three-dimensional objects in a visualization can complicate the visual and confuse 
   the audience. Shapes are also a great way to add eye-catching contrast, especially size contrast to your data story. This circle used for a pie chart lets 
   someone quickly understand the data in a familiar format. Shapes with symmetry are usually more familiar to people, so there's less work for the audience to
   do when viewing symmetrical data viz. But the asymmetrical shapes in this map are still instantly recognizable as countries. It's good to note that the data 
   you're sharing with your audience will usually inform the types of shapes you want to use in your data viz. 
   
   Next, we have colors, and colors are, well, colors. Of course, in the eyes of artists and analysts, colors can be much more complex. Colors can be described by 
   their hue, intensity, and value. The hue of a color is basically its name, red, green, blue and so on. Intensity is how bright or dull a color is, and finally,
   there's value. The value is how light or dark the colors are in a visualization. In more scientific terms value indicates how much light is being reflected. 
   Dark values with some black added are called shades of color, like these shades of green. Light values with white added are called tints, like these tints of
   blue. In this map, there are shades and tints of gray. The value of these colors help us understand the population data in the map and varying the color's value
   can be a very effective way to draw our audience's attention to specific areas. 
   
   Space is the area between, around and in the objects. There should always be space in data visualizations, just not too much or too little. For example, the 
   space between the bars of a bar graph like this one should be smaller than the width of the bars themselves. This will draw the viewer's attention to the bar 
   and the data it represents instead of the empty space. 
  
   Finally, there's movement. Movement is used to create a sense of flow or action in a visualization.
   One of my favorite examples is the data viz, the Wealth and Health of Nations. This viz showcases a correlation between the financial health and physical health
   of nations. It traces these elements over time so you can see how the two correlated effects play out. The movement pulls in data from the 1800s all the way up
   until recently. The interactivity allows for a greater volume of data to be displayed and we'll reveal multiple stories from the same data visualization.
   Remember, this is something that should be used sparingly. There's a fine line between attracting attention and distracting the audience. 
   A static image lets you control all elements of the story you want to tell. When you start incorporating movement and interactivity, the story is controlled by 
   whoever is controlling the interactivity, whether that's you or possibly your audience if you've turned control over to them.
