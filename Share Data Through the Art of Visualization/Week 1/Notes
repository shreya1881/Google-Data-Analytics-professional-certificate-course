-> Data Analytics is the collection and analysis and then use of data to tell stories, using charts and visualizations, so that businesses can make better decisions. 

-> Data visualization is the graphic representation and presentation of data. In reality, it's just putting information into an image to make it easier for other 
   people to understand.

-> Today we can quantify human behavior through data, and we've learned to use computers to collect, analyze and visualize that data. As an analyst in today's world, 
   you'll probably split your time with data visuals in two ways: looking at visuals in order to understand and draw conclusions about data or creating visuals from 
   raw data to tell a story. 

-> Four elements of effective data visualization are: Information(data), Story(concept), goal(function), visual form(story).
   
   Information: the data you are working with

   Story: a clear and compelling narrative or concept

   Goal: a specific objective or function for the visual

   Visual form: an effective use of metaphor or visual expression
   
-> Pre-attentive attributes are the elements of a data visualization that people recognize automatically without conscious effort. The essential, basic building 
   blocks that make visuals immediately understandable are called marks and channels. Marks, Size, Shape, Colour.
   
   Channels are visual aspects or variables that represent characteristics of the data. Channels are basically marks that have been used to visualize data. Accuracy,
   popout, grouping.
