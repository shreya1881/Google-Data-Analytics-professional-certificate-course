-> A dashboard is a tool that organizes information, typically from multiple data sets, into one central location for tracking, analysis, and simple visualization 
   through charts, graphs, and maps. And just like filters and spreadsheets and queries. A dashboard filter is a tool for showing only the data that meets a specific 
   criteria while hiding the rest.

-> Data storytelling is communicating the meaning of a data set with visuals and a narrative that are customized for each particular audience. A narrative is another
   word for a story.
